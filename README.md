This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Product Ordering App with Next.js 13.1.5 and MongoDB (Work In Progress)

## Introduction

`Still not completed yet.`

This app is part of my learning process of fullstack web app built using Next.js framework.
I use Chakra UI for quick UI style. My focus for building the app learn about React.js, Typescript, NextAuth, other Backend side and some architecture such as Test Driven Development (TDD).

## App Idea

- User side

The idea is user can view products, add the product to cart (cart is persist whether the user is logged in or not). Make a payment and then can track the orders process. User also can submit and track progress a tickets for customer support.

- Admin side

Admin can do CRUD on product item, and add/remove discount prices. Process/update the orders status and support tickets status for customer based on it's progress. Create a reports such as sales report.
